# Discogs-Picker

A small Web-App tool to pick a record from my (or maybe your) collection at Discogs.

I build this mini tool to free my mind of finding a record since I sometimes tend to forget which records I actually own :D
Turns out this helped a lot re-discovering a few gems of my collection.

To make this work you have to get an API-Key from Discogs, a collection folder and your username.
You can then just swap these in **the discogs.js** to make your own record picker.

After the initiative fetch all records of the folder will be saved in a variable to minimize the requests to the API.

That's it! Hope it does help someone.
